Monolithic architecture is a unified architecture.  

Microservices break the client and server side into distribured architecture and smaller modular services which can be developed and deployed independently  

when server and client are separated then client and server communicate over API  
 XML/JSON (APIs)  

Facebook Example  
	AUTH >> fb.com/auth/login /signup  
	POST >> fb.com/get/posts  
  
client: username/password > API > Server   
Server > Success/fail   
Success >> Dashboard  
Failure >> show error  

Browse a webpage and right click --> inspect element
